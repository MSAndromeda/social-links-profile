## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility considerations (`prefers-reduced-motion`)

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of semantic HTML, responsive layout using Flexbox, and improving accessibility with motion preferences.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  li > a {
    transition: none !important;
  }
}
```

```css
body {
  font-size: clamp(0.8rem, 2vw, 1rem);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve animation accessibility across all interactive components
- Use CSS Grid for advanced layout systems
- Deepen my understanding of scalable and component-driven design systems
- Optimize responsiveness with modern CSS techniques
